# Notion To Anki

## üóíÔ∏è Overview

The project is implemented mainly for learning purposes and to speed up the process of creating flashcards. As a big fan of the Notion and Anki apps, I decided to do it in a more convenient way. For now, importing cards from Notion databases into the Anki decks is done via HTTP communication.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remarks

- *Notion* ‚Üí due to fact that the official Notion API has not been implemented yet, currently communication takes place from the exported `*.html` file. Full **instruction** on how to properly download the file is provided **below**.
- *Anki* ‚Üí since Anki do not support communication via web browser . Hence, you are obligated to download desktop version and install predefined plugin to be able to send data to your account. As before entire **information** about it is listed **beneath**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To start the application, follow the steps below. Additionally, make sure that you have free two local ports `8080` and `8765`:

- Clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/zborowskibartek/Notion-To-Anki.git`

- Build and run application:

`gradle bootRun`

## ‚òÑÔ∏è **Getting Started**

At this point, the application performs a simple operation - data transfer. To ensure appropriate work, complement request body with presented format.

**POST ‚Üí**¬†transfer all flashcards (must contain **body** request)

`http://localhost:8080/flashcards/transfer`

JSON **body**:

```json
{
   "deckName": "SampleAnkiDeckName",
   "modelName": "Basic",
   "allowDuplicate": false,
   "questionColumn": "cell-title",
   "answerColumn": "cell-Mk~d",
   "table": "Dictionary.html"
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual (will be deprecated when Notion open its API)

- Export **table** or **page with nested table** (but with only one table inside particular Notion page)

## üóª¬†**Future Improvements**

I have been enrolled since the end of 2020 for beta test Notion public API, but unfortunately I am still waiting to access it. I hope they will release it soon. Thanks of that, I'm going to provide communication via user account and its nested databases via HTTP not only from exported file.
